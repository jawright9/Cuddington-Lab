 ## Experiment Preparations (Thursday) 

-   2 weeks prior: Plant 1 tray of pea plants (one seed per pot) and place in growth chamber in the greenhouse

-   1 week prior: 4 plants from the greenhouse growth chambers, 4 aphids (mature adults without wings) on each
-   Place plants in incubator 2 at 20C
    
-   Aphids are left on for **24 hours** at which point the adults are removed and the plants are returned to the incubator for one week for the next experiment.

## Experiment Start (Friday)

-   Collect 2 week old plants from the greenhouse (9-12 plants depending on how many incubators work)

-   One round tray goes in each incubator

    -   Three plants per tray

    -   One even-aged adult aphid on each plant (from experimental prep)

-   Set up incubators

    -   In Celsius:

        -   Select "Settings", then "log on device" (device numbers correlate with incubator number. Device no. needs to match interface), then "OK" from the menu options

        -   File>load tempering profile>from file>select profile>OK

        -   Run>start>create log file> name file in the format as others>save

        -   Check to make sure it is running, there should be a legend in the top right corner

        -   Repeat steps until all incubators are set up

## Experiment Completion (Wednesday)

-   Remove trays from the incubator and count aphids on each plant

    -   Record in lab notebook

    -   Update spreadsheet and metafile

-   Shut down incubators

    -   In Celsius:

        -   Run>stop

        -   File>load tempering profile>from file>select matching profile>OK

        -   File>load protocol data>from file> select matching protocol> OK

        -   File>save protocol data> to report>select save to excel file (make sure that all data is in the selected column)\...\>choose name matching protocol(remove.pro)>OK

    -   Excel file should open with data

        -   Confirm that temperature data was recorded
