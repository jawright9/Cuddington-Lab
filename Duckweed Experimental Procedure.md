# **Duckweed Experimental Procedure**

*Updated: February 2020*

## <span class="underline">Experimental Setup</span>

Duckweed is to be transferred in the laminar flow room (use lab key to open the door). Gloves are required to avoid contamination. Duckweed experiments would run along with the aphid experiments in the incubators (same set up and end time for each run).

1.  For the flow hood, turn on the light (red power button) and the fan (black turbine) to start the laminar flow.

2.  Use ethanol (in flammable cabinet) to wipe the counter in the laminar flow room with paper towel.

3.  Fill the glass alcohol burner with ethanol if low, and adjust the rope if necessary.

4.  Pour \~20 mL (can be a bit less if supplies are low) of the growth medium Hoglands solution (in the large fridge) with a graduated cylinder into 12 small jars, for 3 replicate jars per incubator treatment.

5.  Light the glass alcohol burner with a flame lighter and sterilize the titanium loop. Note that the due to the active air flow, the flame will bend away from the wall (i.e. towards you) so be careful!

    -   Sterilization - place the loop in the flame from the glass alcohol burner above the wick, then remove when the loop glows red. The loop should cool after \~1-2 seconds.

6.  Place two duckweed fronds (from the "Source" duckweed population in incubator 5) with the titanium loop into each treatment jar. In between transfers, sterilize the loop each time.

7.  Place Parafilm over the replicate jars to completely cover them, and label the jars with the date, experiment number, incubator number, mean temperature, and autocorrelation number. Also replace the Parafilm covering the control duckweed population and return it to incubator 5.

8.  Place treatment jars into their corresponding incubator.

9.  Hope the incubators work properly without distractions.

###  Replacing the Medium

If the growth medium looks cloudy and there's a significant amount of debris at the bottom of the duckweed population containers, they need to be replaced.

1.  The day before the actual medium replacement, retrieve a new large beaker to place the duckweed population in. To avoid contamination, the beaker will need to be autoclaved before transfer.

	-  Place three filter papers into the beaker (makes it easier to transfer the duckweed later).

	-  Fully cover the opening of the new beaker with tin foil and label the beaker with "Cuddington, B2 241" with autoclave tape.

	-  With a large white tray (usually in the sink by the incubators), bring the beaker to B2 376 to the autoclave room.

	-  Don't actually work the autoclave machine; just leave the beaker tray to the table closest to the door and leave, and someone else will autoclave the beaker for you.

2.  The next day, the beaker should be autoclaved and ready to go (if the autoclave tape now has black lines, it's been autoclaved). KEEP THE TIN FOIL COVERED, as the beaker will no longer be sterilized once the tin foil is removed. Retrieve it and sterilize and set up the laminar room as in the Experimental Setup procedure.

3.  Remove the filter paper and fill the clean beaker with Hoglands solution with roughly the same amount as in the current population container.

4.  Use the filter paper and scoop the duckweed into the new beaker. The filter paper can only be used once.

5.  Scoop any remaining duckweed with the titanium loop.

6.  Cover the new duckweed population beaker with Parafilm and put back into the incubator.

7.  Duckweed should be happy now!

###  Removing Dead Duckweed

Roughly every two weeks (depending on the health of the population), dead duckweed will need to be removed to avoid the growth of mold and to clear space for growing duckweed.

1.  Setup the laminar flow room outlined in the Experimental Setup procedure.

2.  Get a petri dish of water (doesn't have to be sterilized) to use to discard removed duckweed. This is optional but it beats scrapping small dead plants onto a dry paper towel.

3.  With the titanium loop, pick out any dead duckweed fronds. Dead fronds are typically yellow/white, and not attached to any parent duckweed. The titanium loop should be sterilized between each transfer.

4.  When finished, replace the Parafilm cover for the population container.

5.  Duckweed should be happy now!
